		<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Sebastian Silvernagel and I am a 3D animator specializing in first person animations.
		I am currently looking for a full time permanent job as an animator. I mainly work in Blender but do have baseline experience animating, 
		rigging and exporting files from Maya.</p>

		<p>Ever since I was young I knew I wanted to be a part of the game development process, 
		and until recently I didn't know it would be animation; and I couldn't be happier
		with my career path and I'm excited for the future.</p>
